# culinarian

The Culinarian is a website dedicated to breaking down the science of food in order for people to have more freedom with the experimentation of food.

Creative Brief:

Organizational Goal of The Culinarian: To teach the public the technique and science of cooking by breaking down recipes into components. For example, salad dressings should always be a 1:4 ratio of fat:acid. Once a user understands the basic ratio of a dish and the science behind how certain ingredients interact with each other they no longer need to depend on recipes. The website will encompass video tutorials, articles, infographics, and professional tips.

Task: Create a logo that best describes the marriage between science and food. Use sites such as chefsteps.com and seriouseats.com as reference points for a great logo.
